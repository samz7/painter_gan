<p align="center"><img src="src/sandro-botticelli.png" width=300></p>

This repository is aimed to making a DCGAN model that can generate paintings in the style of the great Sandro Botticelli.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### TODOS

* [generator.py] figure out how to make the generator produce sharp images 


### Prerequisites

Install all the packages listed in the requirements file.
```
conda install --yes --file requirements.txt
```

### Train the GAN

After installing all the dependencies run main.py to start training.

```
python main.py
```




## Built With

* [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) - The deep learning framework used
* [Conda](https://anaconda.org/) - Package Management
